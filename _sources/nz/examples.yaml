- title: NZ Arc Observation Example
  content: |-
    NZ example of a set of Arc Observations demonstrating the three methods for specifying an arc's geometry: **Arc**, 
    **ArcWithCenter**, and **ArcByChord**. Source data is DP 583201, The data set contains four **BoundaryMarks** and 
    two **CadastralMark** (Centre point for arc, and mid point of an arc); one **Chords** and two **Arcs**. The first 
    arc is specified as an **Arc** and references three points, the start of the arc, a point along the arc, and the end 
    of the arc. The second arc is defined as an **arcWithCentre** and include elements defining the Start Point, End 
    Point, and Centre Point for the arc. The third example demonstrates an **ArcByChord** method, Where the 
    **vectorObservation** defines the bearing and distance of the arc's **Chord**. All three examples include 
    **arcLength** and **radius** elements.

- title: NZ Secondary Parcel Example
  content: |-
    Contains **two primary parcels**, Lots 1 & 2, a **secondary parcel**, Area Z, plus **21 SurveyMarks** that define 
    the extent of the parcels, **23 vectorObservations** defining the 23 boundaries (Bearing & Distance), and **23 
    observedVectors** describing the 23 boundary line geometries. Multiple types of interests are also included, 
    Certificate of Title, Amalgamation Conditions, and a Covenant.

- title: NZ Occupation Example
  content: |-
    Contains **four primary parcels**, Lots 1 & 2 plus two Residue Parcels, plus **2 CadastralMarks**, a 
    **GeodeticReferenceMark**, **10 BoundaryMarks**, that define the extent of the parcels, and **10 OccupationMarks** 
    fixing posts/fences/gates that are near the boundaries. There are **30 vectorObservations** defining the 13 
    boundaries (Bearing & Distance), seven survey measurements cadastral and boundary marks, and 10 survey measurements 
    to the occupation marks (posts). There are **30 observedVectors** describing the 13 boundary line geometries, seven 
    survey measurements, and 10 occupation mark measurements (red dashed lines in image below). Boundary marks, 
    occupation marks, and boundaries contain comments regarding the relationship between boundaries, boundary marks, and 
    occupation. The **OccupationMarks** contain a **topology** element defined as a **touches** spatial relationship and 
    references IDs of elements contained in the **occupationFeatures** element. The **occupationFeatures** element is a 
    Feature Collection of fences, a gate, and a hedge, being the occupation that is near the boundaries and Boundary 
    Marks. In this example the **occupationFeatures** data is embedded in the CSD and is encoded using GeoJSON. The 
    element could also link to an external dataset.

- title: Extended NZ example
  content: |-
    DP 572532: Lots 1 and 2 being a subdivision of Lot 14 DP 119553. Consists of a two lot subdivision and a Significant 
    Ecological Area Covenant. Each new parcel has a 1/12th share in an adjacent Access Lot. 35 Survey points are 
    included in the dataset along with 23 calculated and adopted boundary observations, one calculated observation, 14 
    adopted observations, and 15 measured observations using GPS or Theodolite and EDM. All new boundaries have no 
    occupation at the time of survey.
