- title: WA Subtended Angle Observation Example
  content: |-
    Contains three survey marks defining two vectors that form an included angle observation. The included angle 
    references the survey mark where the angle has been observed, the Reference Object (RO) vector that the angle was 
    measured from, and the forward vector that defines the angle. The example also includes three vector observations, 
    being two distances and an angle. Note that the same vector observation pattern is maintained for the two types of 
    observations. For ***distance*** only observations, ***angle*** is **Null**. For the ***angle*** observation, 
    ***distance*** is **Null**. Angles are measured clockwise from the RO to the forward vector.

    WA example of an Arc Observation with additional Chord data. Source data is DP 9678, The data set contains two 
    **BoundaryMarks** and a **CadastralMark** (Centre point for arc); One **Chord** and one **Arc**. The arc is defined 
    as an **arcWithCentre** and includes elements defining the Start Point, End Point, and Centre Point for the arc 
    along with the arc length and radius.

    Contains **six Primary Parcels**, Lots 215 to 220, and **five Easements (Drainage)**, Areas D1 to D5, plus 
    **24 SurveyMarks** that define the extent of the primary and secondary parcels, **34 vectorObservations** defining 
    the 34 boundaries (Bearing & Distance), and **34 observedVectors** describing the 34 boundary line geometries.  Each

- title: WA Circle Example
  content: |-
    Contains a single **Primary Parcel** and a single **Secondary Parcel** representing a proposed Gazette Area for a 
    Cultural Heritage Site. The Secondary Parcel is described by a circle, i.e., the geometry topology type is 
    **CircleByCenter** (requires a center point and a radius). The dataset contains a single coordinate being the center 
    of the circle. Note that the geometry of the primary parcel has not been defined as it was not included in the CSD 
    data provided.

    Contains one **Primary Parcel** (Road Widening) defined by four fixed boundaries and one general boundary, MHW. The 
    general boundary is defined as a **LineString** in this instance. The data set consists of five **BoundaryMarks** 
    defining the fixed boundaries and 19 **CadastralMarks** defining the M.H.W. boundary. The Parcel is defined by seven 
    vectorObservations (4 distances and 3 subtended angles). Eight observedVectors are included (five LineStrings and 
    three Subtended angles). The **Start** and **End** tangents are the red lines. The green line is the spline. The 
    blue line is the right-line version. There is also an Interest/Notification defined for Lot 502.
