## Cadastral Survey Data Model - Western Australia Profile

This profile specifies a 2D version of the Cadastral Survey Data Model (CSDM).

[More information about the ways profiles are specified](https://github.com/opengeospatial/bblock-template/blob/master/PROFILES.md)

This extends the common ICSM Profile with Western Australia specific constraints.

These constraints are defined in a **_machine-readable_** form to support:

- unambiguous interpretation
- conformance validation
- configuration of generic software to meet specific jurisdictional needs. (if implementers choose to use this option)

These constraints define jurisdiction specific options for:

- use of vocabularies for coded values
- provenance (record of process steps)
- labelling conventions and composite name parts
- TBD (test case development in progress)
