## Cadastral Survey Data Model - Western Australia Profile

This profile is the WA (Western Australia) of the Cadastral Survey Data Model (CSDM). This extends the [common ICSM Profile](https://icsm-au.github.io/3d-csdm-profile-icsm/) with Western Australia specific constraints.

It only (currently) defines vocabulary bindings to WA specific vocabularies - but can be extended directly, or via sub-profiles, with further data elements and business rules about content requirements.

[More information about the ways profiles are specified](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/overview/profiles)



These constraints are defined in a **_machine-readable_** form to support:

- unambiguous interpretation
- conformance validation
- configuration of generic software to meet specific jurisdictional needs. (if implementers choose to use this option)
